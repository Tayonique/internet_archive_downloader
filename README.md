<h1>
Bad news for all
</h1>
The extension has just been removed from Chrome WebStore, for the reason:

```
Providing unauthorized access, download, or streaming of copyrighted content or media in the following site(s):

  * archive.org

    * Downloading borrowed limited period books
```

Nevertheless, the extension is still work. And Microsoft Store and Mozilla Store are still available. It is not banned there may be because it is not popular now in their community (User number at Chrome WebStore had reached 55.000 yestoday). But I don't know how long it could survive.

So, you need to save the page link in case of lost. Or click "Watch" button to receive notification for further updates.

# Internet Archive Downloader

[Internet Archive](https://archive.org) holds more than 34 millions books. Some books are permitted to read online by borrowing for a limit period. With the extension, the borrowed books can be downloaded for offline reading.

[HathiTrust Digital Library](https://hathitrust.org) is also supported. All books with full view permission can be downloaded.

The extension works by fetching every leaf of a book, constructing a PDF stream on the fly targeting to disk storage. So it can handle books of thousands of leafs easily with little memory.

## What It Can Do
* Download a book as a PDF file with text embedded
* Download a book as a collection of image files (JPEG/PNG) one for each leaf, and the text of the book
* Optional leaf range
* Optional leaf quality
* Download multiple books in parallel

## Install
For Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc:
* Grab the latest package (.crx) in the [releases](https://github.com/elementdavv/internet_archive_downloader/releases) page.
* Drop the package from file manager to Extension Manager page on your browser (developer mode must be enabled).

For Firefox:
* Grab the latest package (.xpi) in the [releases](https://github.com/elementdavv/internet_archive_downloader/releases) page.
* Drop the package from file manager to Extensions page on your browser.
* Grant all Optional permissions in the Permissions tab of the extension detail page.

Alternatively, install automatically from their repositories:
- [Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/internet-archive-download/keimonnoakgkpnifppoomfdlkadghkjb)
- [Edge Addons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/internet-archive-download/cnpoedgimjaecinmgfnfhfmcpcngeeje)
- [Mozilla Addons (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/internet_archive_downloader/) (All Optional permissions must be granted as well)

## Usage
### Internet Archive:
In [archive.org](https://archive.org), the availability of books lies in three categories:
1) Lending Library
2) Borrow 14 days
3) Always Available

The extension works with category 1 and 2.

After borrowing a book, two new buttons, "Quality" and "Download", appear under the book viewer alongside the "Favorite" button.

After successful downloads, the book will be returned automatically for availability to other users.

### HathiTrust:
No login, no borrows required. In [hathitrust.org](https://hathitrust.org), for books with full view permission, a new section, "Ayesha", appears above the "Download" section on the left-hand side of the page. The section contains three buttons, "Quality", "Tasks" and "Download".
