# Internet Archive Downloader

[Internet Archive](https://archive.org) holds more than 34 millions books. Some books are permitted to read online by borrowing for a limit period. With the extension, the borrowed books can be downloaded for offline reading.

[HathiTrust Digital Library](https://hathitrust.org) is also supported. All books with full view permission can be downloaded.

The extension works by fetching every leaf of a book, constructing a PDF stream on the fly targeting to disk storage. So it consumes only a little RAM resource and can handle books of thousands of leafs easily.

## Features
* Download a book as a PDF file
* Download a book as a collection of image files (JPEG/PNG) one for each leaf
* Optional leaf range
* Optional leaf quality
* Download multiple books in parallel

## Usage
### Internet Archive:
In [archive.org](https://archive.org), the availability of books lies in three categories:
1) Lending Library
2) Borrow 14 days
3) Always Available

The extension works with category 1 and 2.

After borrowing a book, two new buttons, "Quality" and "Download", appear under the book viewer alongside the "Favorite" button.

After successful downloads, the book will be returned automatically for availability to other users.

### HathiTrust:
No login, no borrows required. In [hathitrust.org](https://hathitrust.org), for books with full view permission, a new section, "Ayesha", appears above the "Download" section on the left-hand side of the page. The section contains three buttons, "Quality", "Tasks" and "Download".
