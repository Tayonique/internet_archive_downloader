* To get current book as PDF file, click the "Download" button.
* To get each page as original JPEG file, click the "Download" button with Ctrl key pressed(Command key on Mac).

With the download begins, the button will turn into a progress bar.

There are variant leaf qualities for each book. The extension keeps that up to four levels. To choose any quality, click the stars on the "Quality" button. The more stars the better quality, the larger file size, and the more time it will take to download.

Default is the best quality.
