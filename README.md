None.

## Usage
In archive.org, the availability of books lies in 3 categaries:
* Lending Library
* Borrow 14 days
* Always Available

The extension works with first two categaries. As to the third download links are already there.

After borrowing a book, two new buttons read "Quality" and "Download" will appear under the book reading window, beside the "Favorite" button.

* To get current book as PDF file, click the "Download" button.
* To get each page as original JPEG file, click the "Download" button with Ctrl key pressed(Command key on MacOS).

With the download begins, the button will turn into a progress bar.

There are several levels of page quality available for each book. The extension keeps 4 levels at most. To choose any level, click the stars on the "Quality" button. The more stars the higher quality, the larger file size, and the more time it will take to download.

Default is the highest quality.
