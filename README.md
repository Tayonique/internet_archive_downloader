## Configuration
None.

## Usage
In archive.org, the availability of all books, which mediatype is texts, lies in 3 categaries:
* Lending Library
* Borrow 14 days
* Always Available

The extension works with first two categaries. As to the third one download links are already there.

After borrowing a book, two buttons read "Quality" and "Download" will appear under the book reading window, beside the "Favorite" button.

* To download current book as PDF file, click the "Download" button.
* To download the original JPEG files, click the "Download" button with Ctrl key pressed(Command key on MacOS).

When download begins, the button turns into a progress bar.

There are several levels of page quality available for each book. The extension keeps 4 levels at most. To choose any level, click the stars on the "Quality" button. The more stars the higher quality, the larger file size, and the more time it will take to download.

The default is the highest quality.
